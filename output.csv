1. The contract address, 'eip155:137:0x726bB6aC9b74441Eb8FB52163e9014302D4249e5', is provided correctly according to standards. 

2. The Project Name 'XEN Crypto', and Public Name Tag 'mXENT Token v2' are clear and do not appear to pose any ambiguity.

3. The User Interface/Website URL 'https://xen.network/' could potentially be the related project link.

4. The Public Note 'XEN Crypto's official mXENT Token v2 contract on Polygon' provides additional, relevant information about the contract.

However, there's a critical piece missing. The independent verification of contract information from the internet is unclear, as we cannot find any specific context or information about the contract at this address. Without this independent validation, and based on Kleros ecosystem's rule that ""all IPFS data pertaining to the entry must be accessible and discoverable, otherwise the entry must be rejected"", I am leaning towards not accepting the entry.

With that said, I'm inviting comments from others to further inspect my analysis, as there could be information omitted or overlooked. 

Based on the current information and policy, my verdict is: INCONCLUSIVE.",INCONCLUSIVE

The submission includes a Contract Address that points to a deployed contract, a unique Public Name Tag, and a relevant Project Name. It also provides a URL as the User Interface/Website Link and a concise Public Note.

Since the contract address is not already present in the registry (as indicated by the last paragraph), there is no concern of duplication.

However, due to lack of independent online information about the contract, we lack a secondary validation of the information for the Miyazaki Inu's MIYAZAKI Token. 

Given the details at hand, the submission adheres to the guidelines, and in the absence of contradictory evidence, currently it is comprehensible and not nonsensical.

Given these reasons, I suggest the entry to be ACCEPTED into the registry. Still, I invite others to share their insights or concerns if they think that the decision should be otherwise.",ACCEPT

The token name (Mononoke Inu), contract address (eip155:1:0x4da08a1Bff50BE96bdeD5C7019227164b49C2bFc), and symbol (""Mononoke-Inu"") correlate with the independent findings. Additionally, the token complies with the minimum decimal requirement (9 decimals). 

In terms of submitted logo, although exact contents cannot be reviewed, the given format and size (275x275 px, .png) seem acceptable, as they are greater than the minimal requirement (128x128 px). 

Furthermore, according to the registry, there is no pre-existing entry for this address on this chain, meaning no duplication. 

Finally, no major issues seem to be associated with this token based on the submitted information and online research.

Therefore, considering the presented evidence and in compliance with the Kleros ""Tokens"" Registry Guidelines, I believe we can #ACCEPT# the entry into the registry.

Please feel free to comment on my verdict.",ACCEPT

The specifics are generally correct:

- The contract address provided is in the required format.
- Token name, KleeKai and the symbol, KLEE, appear appropriate.
- There is no repetition of this submission as per the subgraph check.
- The dimensions of the image appear to exceed the minimum requirement of 128x128 px, but we cannot verify the content of the image as required by the guidelines.

However, a significant point to note is the absence of independently obtained information about the contract at the given address. As per the Kleros guidelines, the token contract must be devoid of any major issues. However, we cannot verify the same due to the lack of independent information available. 

Although the submission does not appear as nonsense, the absence of independent verification of the authenticity of the contract and public acknowledgement of the token raises a level of uncertainty. 

Considering the alignment of the provided details with the registry conditions and the lack of external confirmation, I would invite further input based on this analysis. 

For my part, I lean towards an #INCONCLUSIVE# judgement until more data becomes available.",INCONCLUSIVE

Furthermore, the absence of an independent online confirmation from a reliable source raises concerns regarding the token's authenticity. 

While the format and dimensions of the provided logo fit the guidelines, and there's no preexisting entry for this address on the chain, the lack of independent online confirmation results in insufficient certainty about the token's legitimacy.

Hence, the token does not meet all the necessary criteria that would justify its approved entry into the registry as per the current requirements.

I invite anyone to comment, share their thoughts or provide additional information regarding this particular case.

Until such additional information is provided, my verdict for this submitted token is #REJECT#.",REJECT

For the acceptance:

1. The contract address provided exists and is not an Externally Owned Account (EOA). 

2. The project name ""Zapper"" and the public name tag ""SushiSwap Zap In v3.0.0"" create a unique identifier for this contract, which accords to the policy requirement of uniquely and unambiguously identifying the smart contract.

3. The public name tag is unique within the project ""Zapper"", does not exceed the limit of 50 characters and pertains directly to the address being tagged.

4. The information provided doesn't contain any markdown or code, nor does it include descriptors that are vague or dependent on external sources to be understood fully.

5. The tag differentiates the contract effectively by mentioning its version.

6. The submission does not seem to be grossly incorrect or misleading in any way.

7. The UI/Website link provided refers to the relevant product/brand/website.

After a thorough assessment of all the criteria, the contract submission for this address appears to satisfy all the necessary guidelines. I'd appreciate other Kleros juror inputs on this matter to ensure a fair and comprehensive evaluation. 
However, considering all the information available and criteria presented, my juror decision would be to ACCEPT.",ACCEPT

1. **Address**: The submitted address follows the standard CAIP-10 format and does not appear in the existing entries of the same chain.
   
2. **Name**: The name ""Shiba Inu"" and symbol ""SHIB"" are well recognized in the cryptocurrency market, suggesting legitimacy in its prominence. 

3. **Decimals**: The provided decimals count, '18', is common in the crypto ecosystem, aligning with the policy.

4. **Logo**: The logo's format and dimensions fit the policy's requirement, albeit its content couldn't be analyzed. However, the inability to assess the content of the logo does not directly lead to rejection.

The independent search did not reveal specific information about the contract at the addressed 0x6f8a06447Ff6FcF75d803135a7de15CE88C1d4ec. Although this lack of information is a concern, it does not violate the acceptance rules directly, as these do not strictly necessitate external contract-specific information.

Considering above findings, I would #ACCEPT# this submission into the registry, assuming it does not contain any major issues not highlighted in this case. My conclusion relies on available data and policy rules, and I invite further examination and discussions from other jurors. However, note that my acceptance is on condition that the submitted entry provides true and accurate data. Moreover, continuous accessibility and discoverability of all IPFS data should be maintained per the submission period as per policy guidelines.",ACCEPT

The key fields in the submission, namely the Contract Address, Public Name Tag, Project Name, and UI/Website Link, follow the rules stipulated in the policy document.

However, upon conducting an independent search online, we were unable to find any significant evidence or corroborating information about the contract at the given address. While the absence of such information doesn't necessarily indicate wrongfulness, it does complicate efforts towards confirmation of this submission.

Therefore, until any additional or missing information can be found or supplied, I find it difficult to make a definitive judgment on whether the entry should be accepted into the registry.

On this basis, I would like to invite others to weigh in on their view of this matter as well.

The Contract Address points to an identifiable deployed contract associated with the Project Name ""Introducing World App,"" which hosts the ""WLDAPP Token"". 

The Public Name Tag and Project Name uniquely identify the contract. Additionally, the Public Notation has aptly included details not mentioned in other fields. The provided URL leads to a relevant interface for the corresponding token, which supports legitimacy and verifiability.

Furthermore, independent research indicates that the information regarding the contract is accurate, and the contract itself is transactionally active on the Ethereum blockchain. It has also been verified that there are no duplicate entries for this contract address in the registry.

In view of these facts and after careful assessment, I would invite others to comment before concluding, I propose this entry to be ACCEPTED.",ACCEPT

The token name ""SunContract"" does not carry any suffix such as “Token” or “Coin”, which is in accordance with the rules. The submitted contract address does not appear to be duplicated and the CAIP-10 format (eip155:1:0xF4134146AF2d511Dd5EA8cDB1C4AC88C57D60404) appears legitimate. The token symbol ""SNC"" matches the name, and the decimal count of 18 is standard.

However, independent online validations have not conclusively established what the specific contract at address 0xF4134146AF2d511Dd5EA8cDB1C4AC88C57D60404 is for, leaving room for potential concern over its veracity. Furthermore, the image dimensions listed in the application are larger than the 128px X 128px requirement stated in the policy. As per my understanding, though the guidelines do not pose an explicit upper limit to the image size, the given image size could potentially cause formatting and performance issues.

The provided information rests on the verge of acceptance but leaves certain aspects largely unverified. Although the submitted details fulfill required guidelines on the surface, further investigation is needed to comprehensively ascertain this entry's legitimacy.

Your thoughts and comments regarding this submission are welcomed and highly appreciated. For the time being, my judgment on this particular entry submission is #INCONCLUSIVE#.",INCONCLUSIVE

Public Name Tag: mXENT Token v2

adhere to the requirements outlined in the registry guidelines, barring any independent information available about the contract through a search online. They have not utilized any markdown or code, the Public Name Tag is under 50 characters, and the fields do not appear to contain ambiguous or abstract terms. Furthermore, the public note and name tag both indicate that this is the second version of the XEN Crypto's official mXENT Token.

Given that the information was unable to be verified through an independent source, due to lack of context or details about this particular smart contract, it might be worth contacting the submitter for more information or wait for further evidence that corroborates the details provided. However, based solely on the contract submission details and the registry guidelines, and with the assumption that the contract indeed points to a valid contract (not an EOA), the details seem to meet the essential criteria.

As per the policy, the inability to find independent online information should not factor into the decision unless the independently found details contradict the applicant's submission or indicate a potential case of fraud, neither of which is evident from the provided details.

The only potential issue, the preexistence of an entry for the contract address, has been negated. Hence, there are no violations detected against the acceptance policy.

In this case, as per the provided details and the policy rules articulated in the Kleros “Address Tag” Registry Guidelines document, I recommend that the submission should be ACCEPTED. I invite others to verify and comment on this judgment for further validation.

The token name ""Mononoke Inu"" has been corroborated independently on the internet. The contract address ""eip155:1:0x4da08a1Bff50BE96bdeD5C7019227164b49C2bFc"" has successfully mapped to the Mononoke Inu token on the Ethereum blockchain. With the symbol ""Mononoke-Inu"" aligning with online research.

Additionally, the requirement of the logo being in PNG format and having a size of at least 128x128px is met as the logo dimensions exceed the minimum requirement at 275x275px.

It has also been confirmed that there is no existing entry for this address on this chain, complying with the policy that in case of duplicates, only the first submission should be accepted.

Thus, the entry submission appears to be valid in light of the Kleros Tokens Registry Guidelines. However, as I cannot verify the content of the IPFS data pertaining to the entry, the acceptance of this submission is subject to that data being accessible and discoverable.

1. The spelling and capitalization of the name 'KleeKai' appear to be consistent with common usage.
2. The provided contract address is in the correct format.
3. The number of decimals, recorded as 9, is acceptable.
4. The logo provided adheres to the PNG format and it has a size of 1273x1309px, which is acceptably above the prescribed minimum size of 128px X 128px.
5. There appears to be no pre-existing entry for this address on this chain according to the registry subgraph.
6. The symbol 'KLEE' seems appropriate and is coherent with the name of the token.

However, given that no additional independent information about this token contract was found online, a full validation of its legitimacy remains inconclusive.  While the provided submission data seems to conform to the guidelines, the absence of third-party verification necessitates further investigation.

For token acceptance, it is crucial to ensure the token's legitimacy, conformance with the provided guidelines, and absence of any potential harm for platform users. Currently, we lack sufficient data to guarantee that all these conditions are met. 

Therefore, my judgment is: INCONCLUSIVE.

This lack of information creates uncertainty regarding the trustworthiness and validity of the token contract.

The logo adheres to the requirement of a PNG format and a size of at least 128px x 128px, since the provided size is 400px x 400px. However, without access to the contents, we cannot determine if the symbol follows the other stipulated guidelines, such as being centered, taking up most of the space, not including the project or token name unless always included, and exhibiting high definition without appearing pixelated or blurry (unless purposely designed that way).

Also important is the absence of any existing entry for this address on this chain, which aligns with the Acceptance rules in the policy.

Despite some conformity with the policy, the lack of specific verified information about the contract brings the credibility and reliability of this address into question. This ambiguity can potentially expose users to financial loss or security breaches, which goes against the guideline of ensuring tokens that users can safely interact with.

Considering these points, I invite the community to further discuss and scrutinize this submission. Based on the data currently available to us, my decision would be:

Key points for consideration:

- The Contract Address points to a deployed smart contract and not a regular wallet, complying with the required acceptance criteria.
- The Project Name 'Zapper', coupled with the Public Name Tag 'SushiSwap Zap In v3.0.0', uniquely identifies the smart contract, eliminating ambiguity.
- The Public Name Tag seems to be unique within the project and adheres to the character limit rule. It merely describes the address being tagged which is in line with the policy.
- The provided User Interface/Website link directs to the relevant product/brand/website.
- The Public Note field provides additional clarifying information on the contract.

Given this information, I'm confident to suggest that the entry should be accepted into the registry.

However, I encourage open discussion. If there's anyone who holds contradictory views, or additional information that can influence the verdict, please come forward and share accordingly.

The ""Shiba Inu"" token entry has shared correct and required format information about name, symbol, decimals, and logo, and there is no previous entry for this address on this chain. 

However, independent verification didn't provide any detailed information about the contract at address 0x6f8a06447Ff6FcF75d803135a7de15CE88C1d4ec. This could mean two things - either the token is very new and not yet recognized in online resources, or that it's not legitimate.

As the Kleros ecosystem operates with certainty and requires that information found independently from the internet about the contract address should be available, it is difficult to give a conclusive verdict.

1. The contract address leads to a deployed contract, and it isn’t an EOA.
2. The Project Name ('Introducing World App') and Public Name Tag ('WLDAPP Token') present together identify the contract without confusion.
3. The Public Name Tag is presumably unique within the project, contains less than 50 characters, and only describes the address being tagged.
4. There's no detected use of markdown, codes, or vague descriptors. 
5. The given context doesn’t suggest that there is an instance of the same contract deployed on the same chain warranting a differentiation.
6. There are no grammatical discrepancies, and no competing formatting perspective is provided.
7. The UI/Website link leads to the relevant product, fitting the requirement— even though a more detailed link could have been provided.
8. The IPFS data was not mentioned but was not required.

The token name, contract address, decimals, and symbol have been correctly provided.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy regarding the contract address' associated information. Independent research indicates that there is no information available related to this particular address, which raises concerns about its validity or, at the very least, its reputation. An accepted entry into the Kleros token registry must be verifiable and reliable.

Additionally, while the logo format is a .png as required and its dimensions exceed the minimal 128x128px stipulation, without being able to actually view the image, we cannot confirm if it adheres to the remaining logo-specific guidelines mentioned in the policy, such as being centered, occupying most of the space, or not including the project or token name. 

In light of the above, without immediate access to further clarifying data, the decision is: INCONCLUSIVE. It is advisable to request further verification related to the contract address and visual confirmation of the logo before making a definitive decision on this entry.

1) The name 'VitaDAO' and symbol 'VITA' are clearly stated, meeting the submission requirements for these fields.

2) The contract address 'eip155:1:0x81f8f0bb1cB2A06649E51913A151F0E7Ef6FA321' has been provided, fulfilling the required format.

3) The decimals '18' fall within the customary range for tokens.

However, I have concerns about the logo:

1) Despite the dimensions of the logo not matching the predefined 128x128px, the policy does not strictly demand identical width and height. But, the 231x187 pixels fails to meet the minimum requirement of 128px on all sides. 
   
2) From the details provided, I cannot check the logo's quality or visibility at 10cm by 10cm—which suggests possible pixelation or blur, particularly since the logo's original dimensions are smaller than the minimum requirement.

The lack of independently verified information about the contract is a source of concern. The guidelines call for entries to not contain major issues. This aspect cannot be confirmed due to insufficient information.

In light of these shortcomings, while the submission just about meets the minimal criteria, reservations particularly about the logo and independent confirmation necessitate a cautious verdict.

Hence, I invite other Kleros jurors to share their opinions before a final action. As for my proposal, based on the information available and considering the deviations from the guidelines, my preliminary verdict is: INCONCLUSIVE.",INCONCLUSIVE

The contract is recognized as an ERC1967Proxy contract, hence it is not an EOA. The Project Name ""Blur"" and Public Name Tag ""Marketplace 2"" collectively provide a unique identifier for the contract. The website link is valid and refers directly to the relevant project.

However, it's worth noting independently sourced information reveals the contract being a proxy, which behaves as a 'front' for another contract (upgradeable logic). In such cases, the significance is often on the underlying contract, which is potentially upgradeable, rather than the proxy itself. The submitted Public Note does not provide any additional clarity on this matter, nor does it indicate anything about the upgradeability of the contract. 

In light of the above considerations, it is evident that while the submission adheres to the basic requirements of the policy, there exists potential ambiguity regarding the exact contract the listing refers to due to the nature of proxy contracts.

It would be beneficial to seek more input or acknowledgment from the project owners or further explore the underlying contract(s) that the proxy points to, which could help in delivering a more definitive judgment. 

Hence, my current position can only be labelled as INCONCLUSIVE.

First, while the logo's dimensions of 2000 x 2000 surpass the minimum requirement as dictated by the policy, it's important to note that without being able to view its content, we can't make a definitive judgement as to whether it adheres fully to the guidelines.

Second, independent verification of the token's provided contract address revealed no substantial outcomes from online investigation. This lack of supporting evidence can be a potential red flag, albeit not necessarily a disqualifying one, as it could be due to the obscure or new status of the token project.

Third, our search within the ecosystem confirmed that there is no existing entry for this address on this chain, which identifies a fundamental requirement of the registry's policy.

Given these factors, it's not entirely clear whether the submission, as it stands, entirely satisfies the acceptance policy. The investigation primarily tumbles on the non-verification of the contract address and the unknown content of the logo file.

The contract address in CAIP-10 format points to a deployed smart contract as per guidelines. The submitted Project Name (Sushiverse) and Public Name Tag (SV Token) align with each other uniquely identifying the smart contract. The user interface/website link provided leads to the project, and the public note adds relevant information about the smart contract. Relevant information about the project and token could not be independently verified online, which would usually need to be done to ensure the information is accurate.

The submitted contract address points to a deployed contract associated with the Small Love Potion (SLP) token in the Axie Infinity Project, hence it is not an EOA. The Project Name is correctly identified as 'Axie Infinity'. The Public Name Tag 'SLP V1 Token' is coherent and it is within the 50 characters limit.

The UI/Website link correctly refers to the official website of the Axie Infinity project. As for the Public Note, it briefly comments ""Contract of Axie Infinity's SLP V1 Token"", which is understandable and relevant to the contract.

Having considered the Tag Acceptance Criteria, and the independently gathered evidence, which confirms that there is no already existing entry for this address on this chain, the submitted entry appears to meet the requirements for inclusion into the registry.

Unless there are additional aspects not mentioned or seen at this moment that could bring the submission into question, the current conclusion leans towards acceptance.

- The Contract Address points to a smart contract, as required.
- The Project Name, SingularityNET, is correctly provided.
- The Public Name Tag is 'AGI Token', which is unique, less than 50 characters, and refers to the smart contract in question.
- The UI/Website Link provided is relevant to the project.
- The Public Note is informative and does not contain any markdown or code.
  
However, a key point of consideration here is that the Public Note refers to the token as a 'pre-hardfork version of the AGIX token'. This denotes that there may be an updated version of the contract address. As the rules dictate, there should be a distinguishable difference between instances or versions of the same contract. In this case, the tag for this 'pre-hardfork' version should specify this detail for clarity.

Given the absence of any contradicting information from other sources, I believe the submission mostly adheres to the guidelines. Yet, there's a need to clarify the pre-hardfork state to prevent potential confusion with its successor (AGIX). To maintain clarity, I recommend amending the Name Tag to 'AGI Token (Pre-Hardfork).' After this adjustment, the submission should align well with the ""Kleros Address Tag"" Registry requirements.

This is based on my interpretation of the policy. However, I invite others to critique this analysis and provide alternative views. 

Judging based on the current information, approach, and guidelines, my verdict would be: INCONCLUSIVE until the suggested amendment is made.",INCONCLUSIVE

Public Note: Contract of GhostsProject's GHOST Token

According to the acceptance policy:

- The field Contract Address points to a deployed contract.

Until evidence of a deployed contract at this address is provided, I would recommend not accepting this entry into the Kleros “Address Tag” Registry.

Furthermore, no markdown or code is found in the fields. The Public Note provided is a short, mandatory comment about the contract that fits into the public name tag. It thus serves its intended purpose.

The link to the user interface/website (https://salazar.finance/) is appropriate and relates to the relevant product/brand/website.

Despite the lack of abundant information about the contract on the internet, there is nothing in the submission that is grossly incorrect or misleading, and the submission fits within the outlined rules of the registry's acceptance policy.

According to the Kleros ""Address Tag"" Registry guidelines, the submission must contain the CAIP-10 format contract address, a unique and commonly used public name tag, the project name, a URL of the most popular user interface or the official website, and a short public note about the contract. The information submitted verifies these attributes correctly - we have a valid Contract Address, a distinct Public Name Tag, a named Project, a provided UI/Website Link, and a concise Public Note. 

Moreover, the guidelines assert that the information should uniquely and unambiguously identify the smart contract, and the Project Name in combination with the Name Tag appears to fulfil this criterion.

However, we should note that no independent information about the contract could be found from the internet search. This raises a bit of concern about the verifiability of the provided information. Yet, absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence. The unavailability of data might be due to the contract being private, new, or not yet indexed correctly by search engines.

Given the presented data and the guidelines of the Kleros Address Tag registry, and given that there isn't any direct violation, while also noting that independent verification of the provided information is currently missing, I would say the result for this submission is INCONCLUSIVE.

In the Kleros Tokens Registry Guidelines, it is explicitly stated that ""Contract addresses are an attack vector and should be checked carefully."" Given the conflicting details and the inability to confirm the authenticity of the submitted contract address, it's prudent to exercise caution here.

The contract address does not appear to have any pre-existing entries on this chain, which fulfills the requirement of absence of duplicates. The logo meets the specified dimensions and format requirements. 

However, the major issue that raises concerns is the lack of dependable information about the specific contract at the given address, based on the independent search results. This makes it difficult to confirm the authenticity and validity of the token contract.

Therefore, due to the uncertainty surrounding the token contract addressed at 0xEE06A81a695750E71a662B51066F2c74CF4478a0, I suggest the need for further investigation. This recommendation is made on the basis that no definitive conclusion about the acceptance of the entry can be drawn without complete information. 

Therefore, my verdict is INCONCLUSIVE. I welcome further comments or inputs on the matter to help reach a more precise conclusion.",INCONCLUSIVE

The entered contract address is in the correct format and the name tags seem to be clear and appropriately describing the smart contract. The project name is provided hence helping to identify the contract.

The only issue observed is the lack of independently found information about the contract address submitted. But since the absence of independent information does not necessarily violate the acceptance policy, it can be considered that the submission is compliant with the rules.

Considering the above, I reach an assumption of acceptability for the registry. However, I'd like to hear others' thoughts on this.

Moreover, the provided Public Note is informative and concise, offering a clear explanation about the smart contract in question. 

Moreover, there doesn't seem to be any information contradicting the tag submission found online. It must be noted here that the lack of additional, independently found data does not alone serve as a reason to reject the submission, particularly because there is no specific rule in the guidelines that demands external validation.

The Contract Address points to an actual deployed contract. The Project Name, ""ParaSpace,"" is also clearly defined. Its Public Name Tag, “Pool Proxy,” is unique, unambiguous, and is less than 50 characters. It does not contain markdown or code, avoiding complexity. Furthermore, the Public Note elaborates the role of the contract, i.e., the ""official Pool Proxy contract of ParaSpace."" 

As specified by the acceptance policy, the submission does not contain descriptors that can't be fully understood without referring to other address tags or sources. Even though the exact purpose of the contract is not detailed, the entry, as it stands, does not seem misleading or incorrect. The provided URL links to the correct product/brand/website in relation to the explained function of the contract.

Lastly, the fact that there are no duplicate tags for this address on this chain also reinforces the case for its inclusion.

Given these reasons, I propose that we ACCEPT this entry into the registry.

The submitted contract address, 'eip155:1:0x984f7B398d577C0ADDE08293a53aE9D3B6b7a5c5', has been verified as pointing to a deployed contract and is correctly marked as 'SAC Token' under 'Stoner Ape Club'. The public note is clear and informative. Additionally, the 'UI/Website Link' field leads to a relevant product/brand/website. 

Furthermore, the public name tag is unique within the given project name and does not contain any form of descriptors requiring further information. Its length and content are compliant with the guidelines.

Given these circumstances, where no rules are violated and the provided information seems relevant to the smart contract, the entry can be accepted.

1. The supplied name (Alchemix) adheres to the requirement of being the most commonly used name to denote the asset.
2. In terms of the contract address, it is assumed that it is correctly submitted, since this is not possible to verify on my end.
3. The symbol (ALCX) fulfills the requirement of being represented as a transparent PNG image of minimally 128x128px, as the dimensions are stated to be 500x500px. 

However, it is necessary to note that no independent information regarding the validity of the contract address was found from the online search. This raises concerns about the authenticity of the contract. Additionally, the token logo's content was also not visible, which prevents the evaluation of a few more acceptance criteria stated in the policy.

Therefore, due to the lack of crucial information regarding the contract address and the token logo's content, my recommendation for this entry is INCONCLUSIVE. I encourage those involved in the Kleros ecosystem to provide their perspectives on this case.",INCONCLUSIVE

Further, a user interface/website link is also provided. However, an independent verification of the contract's address could not yield any corroborating evidence about the contract's existence, purpose, or functionality. 

Assessing the provided data closely, the ""Public Name Tag"" as ""Ethereum Bridge"" could be a valid indication if the contract serves the purpose of bridging assets between Ethereum and the Synapse network. The ""Project Name"" aligns well as ""Synapse"" and is likely linked with the associated website https://synapseprotocol.com/. The ""Public Note"" confirms the contract's purpose as ""Synapse's official Ethereum Bridge contract,"" again providing consistency in the submitted information.

The lack of independent online information might be due to the contract being relatively new or not yet indexed by search engines.

In summary, while the submitted information appears valid and consistent within itself, the lack of independent online validation makes it somewhat unclear. Therefore, given the information at hand and the rules established in the acceptance policy, the final verdict regarding the validity of the entry cannot be conclusively made. An additional review from other members might be necessary for a final decision.

Firstly, the token's name and symbol data provided appear legitimate and match with existing knowledge of a token called Owl (OWL) in the market. However, the guidelines put forth in the acceptance policy mention that the contract addresses should be carefully checked given they are potential attack vectors. We can't be certain the contract address provided is legitimate with the independent information collected which does not provide any specific details about this contract.

Secondly, though the dimension and format of the submitted logo fulfill the requirements, we are unable to confirm its authenticity or relevance given that we can't view its contents.

Furthermore, we miss thorough independent research about the token indicating that it is free of any major issues, especially considering security threats, as underlined in the acceptance policy. The information submitted may not be nonsense, but it also leaves considerable ambiguity.

In conclusion, there is doubt on the validity and legitimacy of the information provided for this token entry, leaving me with the decision to deem the analysis as INCONCLUSIVE. I am open to any further comments or lens to view this case to reconsider this conclusion.",INCONCLUSIVE

The core points to evaluate are as follows: 

1. The name and symbol provided are reasonable and match with the submission's principles and guidelines. 

2. The logo dimensions exceed the minimum size requirements stated by the policy. Although we are unable to evaluate the quality and content of the logo due to lack of visibility, the token submitter asserts its format and dimension. 

3. The contract address given is in the correct format and does not conflict with any existing entries in this chain. 

However, a key concern arises in the absence of actionable information confirming the authenticity of the contract address. This lack of verification significantly inhibits our ability to assess independently whether the token contract is free from any major issues. Given this hurdle, we are unable to confidently deem that this token aligns with the security standards professed in the acceptance policy. Thus, accepting it could potentially compromise the intended safety assurance of the ecosystem.

It also correctly represents the project name as ""NEST Protocol"" and the public name tag as unique and unambiguous. The combination ""NEST Protocol: nToken Oracle 3"" details the contract uniquely.

As for the rest of the criteria, the Public Name Tag (""nToken Oracle 3"") does not use markdown or code and is 16 characters long. It does not rely on external sources for understanding and appears to differentiate the contract correctly within the project context.

The UI/Website Link and Public Note align with the contract and do not appear misleading. They offer relevant background information and context.

There is also no existing entry with the same address, preventing duplicate issues. All required information is accessible from the provided IPFS.

Given all these observations align with the acceptance criteria, and given the absence of contradictory evidence, I suggest adding this submission to the registry.

The Contract Address, specified under its CAIP-10 address as eip155:1:0x4F8730E0b32B04beaa5757e5aea3aeF970E5B613, points to a valid, deployed smart contract. 

The Project Name, ""Bloot"", correctly identifies the project associated with the contract. 

The Public Name Tag, ""BLOOT Token"", uniquely and unambiguously identifies the contract within the project Bloot. Furthermore, this name adheres to the text requirements specified in the guidelines, including uniqueness, a maximum character length of 50, and absence of markdown and code. 

The User Interface / Website Link provided, https://www.bloot.org/, directs to a pertinent resource related to the contract and project. 

The Public Note, stating ""Contract of Bloot's BLOOT Token"", provides a concise, clear, and informative comment about the contract. 

The submission does not appear to contain incorrect or misleading information and there is no existing entry for this contract address in the registry, which would warrant immediate rejection. 

Considering all these points, the evidence suggests that the tag submission meets the acceptance criteria for this registry.

The Public Name Tag, ""Fast Gas / Gwei ACOA 1"", is unique, commonly used, and does not contain markdown or code. It appears to clearly describe the function or purpose of the contract, which aligns with the criteria presented in the guidelines under the Field Elements.

The UI/Website Link, ""https://chain.link/"", indeed refers to a relevant product/brand/website, which does not violate any of the stipulations in the tag acceptance criteria.

The Public Note, ""Chainlink's Fast Gas / Gwei ACOA ( Access Controlled Offchain Aggregator) 1 contract"", is informative, clear, and within the guidelines of what's desired for this field. 

However, as the independent research stated, there is no clear information available about the contract at the contract address provided. Given that the acceptance policy states that ""The field Contract Address must point to a deployed contract"", there is no confirmation that this contract indeed belongs to Chainlink as the submitter claims.

There is also no provided information indicating there is already an existing entry for this contract in the registry, or the contrary. 

Given these considerations, the evidence presented is insufficient to conclusively accept the contract into the registry. More information is needed to correlate the contract address with Chainlink and its purported functions as described by the submitter.
